    "information": "If early Mars had a denser atmosphere and warmer climate, nearly a third of its surface could have been covered by liquid water. It would have filled the Vastitas Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere, which mysteriously lies 4-5 km below the mean planetary elevation. Today enough methane lingers in the thin Martian air to indicate possible methanogen life dwelling under the surface, safe from cosmic radiation.",

Despite the hellish conditions, life could have gotten an early start. -- Simone-Marchi, 2014",

Comets seem to have a ratio of deuterium to hydrogen twice that found in ocean water, meaning that at most 10% of Earth's oceans were delivered by comets.",

This explains why Luna seems to be geologically a devolatilized version of the Earth. For 2000 years Earth had a rock vapor atmosphere.",
