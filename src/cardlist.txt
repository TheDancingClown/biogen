      "information": "If early Mars had a denser atmosphere and warmer climate, nearly a third of its surface could have been covered by liquid water. It would have filled the Vastitas Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere, which mysteriously lies 4-5 km below the mean planetary elevation. Today enough methane lingers in the thin Martian air to indicate possible methanogen life dwelling under the surface, safe from cosmic radiation.",
